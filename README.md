# HSE IDA Deep Learning

Jupyter Notebooks for HSE IDA Deep Learning course

1) hw1 contains code for different optimization methods and variations of Gradient Descent
2) hw2 Speed comparison between NumPy and Tensorflow. Tuning learning rate and momentum. Tensorflow MLP trained on MNIST
3) hw3 Constructing CNN model based on CIFAR-10 dataset with 85+ accuracy. Model performance comparison using different weight initialization
